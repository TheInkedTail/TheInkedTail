    <h2>Meet Michael</h2>
    <p>Michael Garcia is a fantasy and speculative fiction author whose work delves into the rich, strange, and sometimes unsettling corners of storytelling. With a love for character-driven narratives and intricate worldbuilding, his stories often explore themes of identity, loss, resilience, and redemption.</p>
    
    <p>Raised on adventure, tabletop games, and mythical stories, Michael’s early fascination with storytelling evolved into a full-fledged craft. He draws inspiration from many games, stories, and personal experiences to create thoroughly developed worlds and stories.</p>

    <p>When he’s not writing, Michael is usually expanding on world building, enjoying story rich games, or connecting with readers. He believes stories aren’t just entertainment — they’re a window into a world, new experiences, and ways to connect with like-minded people.</p>

    <p>Michael currently publishes serialized fiction on <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/profile/708964" style="color: var(--accent-color); text-decoration: underline;">Royal Road</a>, with two growing titles under his belt and more to come.</p>
