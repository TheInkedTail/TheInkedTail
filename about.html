    <h2>Meet Michael Garcia</h2>

    <p>Mike writes character-driven fantasy and science fiction grounded in worlds that feel alive. His work is built on vivid, immersive worldbuilding — the kind where he spends days (sometimes weeks) crafting lore, economics, and magic systems before writing a single scene.</p>

    <p>His debut novel, <em>Tail of the Stray</em>, started as a backstory to his D&amp;D player character, Velrik. What began as a simple idea in a tabletop campaign became a series exploring the lore-rich world of Eldrin through Velrik's eyes.</p>

    <p>Michael's love for storytelling came from TTRPGs and story-rich games like The Witcher and Baldur's Gate. He spends countless hours building world outlines and grows them while writing. The goal isn't just a setting — it's a world that breathes.</p>

    <p>When he's not writing, he's deep in worldbuilding lore, gaming, coding, hiking, or listening to whatever's playing — metal, anime soundtracks, polka, sometimes all three in the same afternoon.</p>

    <p>He believes good stories aren't simply about escaping reality — they're about immersing yourself in a completely new one for the sake of curiosity and exploration.</p>
