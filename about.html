    <h1>The Inked Tail</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official website of the author, Michael Garcia</p>
  </header>


  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Meet Michael Garcia</h2>
    <p>Mike writes character-driven fantasy and science fiction grounded in worlds that feel alive. His work is built on vivid, immersive worldbuilding—the kind where he spends days (sometimes weeks) crafting lore, economics, and magic systems before writing a single scene.</p>
    
    <p>His debut novel, Tail of the Stray, started as a backstory to his D&D player character, Velrik. What began as a simple idea in a tabletop campaign, became a series exploring the lore rich world of Eldrin through Velrik's perception.</p>

    <p>Michael's love for storytelling came from TTRPGs and story-rich games like The Witcher and Baldur's Gate. He spends countless hours and days to create a rich world outline, and builds on it while writing. The goal isn't just a setting—it's a world that breathes.</p>

	<p>When he's not writing, he's deep in worldbuilding lore, gaming, coding, hiking, or listening to whatever's playing—metal, anime soundtracks, polka, sometimes all three in the same afternoon.</p>
	
    <p>He believes good stories aren't simply about escaping reality—they're about immersing yourself in a completely new one for the sake of curiosity and exploration.</p>
