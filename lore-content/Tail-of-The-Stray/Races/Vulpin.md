## The Vulpin

The **Vulpin** are a rare, foxlike race known for their agility, sharp senses, and elusive nature. Slightly shorter than the average human, their bodies are built for speed and stealth, with digitigrade legs that give them a light, springy stride. They are covered in soft fur that thickens with the seasons, providing natural insulation during colder months. Vulpin have expressive, upright ears, tapered muzzles, and sharp, intelligent eyes that range in hue from earthy browns to amber golds. Their most distinctive feature is their long, bushy tail, which aids in balance and reflects their mood much like a cat’s. While they are uncommon in the wider world, Vulpin are quick learners and often adapt well to unfamiliar environments. Despite their animalistic features, they are fully sapient, capable of speech, empathy, and complex thought—though they are sometimes misjudged by those unfamiliar with their kind.
